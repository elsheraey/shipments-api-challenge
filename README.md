# Shipments API Challenge

This repository contains my solution to an API challenge that was part of an interview process. The challenge was implemented using NestJS, a powerful framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.

To understand the details of the challenge and how I approached it, please refer to this [README.md](./challenge/README.md). It provides comprehensive information on the problem statement, and includes all test cases that are required to pass.

Feel free to explore the code to get a better understanding of my solution. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
